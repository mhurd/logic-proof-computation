## Model Theory

`4 = (2 + x)` is an *open sentence* (it has *variables*), if we replace the variables with *constants* then we get a *closed sentence* which may be true or false. If the sentence can be made true then this *interpretation* is considered a *model* of that sentence, if it is made false then it is a *countermodel* of that sentence. If the sentence has at least one model it is considered *satisfiable*. 

There are two special cases:

1. An open sentence is *valid* if only when every interpretation is a model of that sentence (i.e. `x + y = y + x`)
2. An open sentence is *countervalid* only if every interpretation is a countermodel of that sentence (i.e. `x + 1 = x`)
