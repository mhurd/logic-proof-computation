## Lecture 3 - Truth Tables and Propositional Calculus

#### Logic

Logic is the study of argument. In the West, Aristotle is credited with codifying its rules but modern logic was the child of Gottlob Frege who's program of *logicism* attempted to reduce mathematics to logic and set theory. In addition he created a formal notation for logic.

#### The Syntax of Propositional Calculus

Frege's logical system has two parts; *propositional calculus* (sometimes called *sentential logic*) and *predicate calculus* (also called *first-order logic*).
